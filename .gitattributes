# More specific patterns override earlier patterns

# STRIP outputs from all notebooks by default
*.ipynb filter=jupyter

# KEEP outputs in documentation notebooks (docs/)
# This overrides the above pattern for docs/**/*.ipynb
docs/**/*.ipynb !filter

# Set the default behavior, in case people don't have core.autocrlf set.

# Explicitly declare text files you want to always be normalized and converted
# to native line endings on checkout.
